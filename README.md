# Sales Dashboard with Power BI

In conjunction with Hashtag Treinamentos in their Intensive Power BI Course, I've crafted this dashboard to show the initial results of the study, integrating seamlessly the thousands of lines of the dataset, using various methods of transformation using Power Query and its multiple functionalities, then finally developing the reports, carefully placed in this dashboard.

As is usual with Power BI, this dashboard is dynamic, changing its values just by focusing on the intended information, the rest of the dash will follow suit, showing only pertinent info the user will require.
